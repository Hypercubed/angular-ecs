<p>There are many great game engines available for JavaScript.  Many include all the pieces needed to develop games in JavaScript; a canvas based rendering engine, optimized and specialized game loop, pixel asset management, dependency injection, and so on.  However, when developing a web game using AngularJS you may want to use only some parts of the game engine and leave other parts to Angular. To do this it often means playing tricks on the game engine to cooperate with angularjs. Angular-ecs is a entity-component-system built for and with AngularJS.  Angular-ecs was built to play nice with the angular architecture and to feel, as much as possible, like a native part of the angular framework.</p>
